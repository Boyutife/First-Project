				I'm a photographer based in manhattattan, NYC and westport, CT who documents love stories, portraits and editorials in a candid and stylish way, from earning a MA in art history at NYU, to studying modern choreography at Alvin Alley, to refining my compositional eye as a researcher at sotheby's, I have always been drawn to art in all its mediums. With this profound understanding of human expression and three dimensional form, I naturally gravitated toward photography. I explored all its techniques and genres and ultimately fell in love with wedding photography.

			<!--<p>
				Preserving moments that often go unseen during a wedding, yet which carry so much emotional value, brings me joy. I want you to see how your mom teared up while watching you walk down the alsle, how proudly your dad hugged your future husband just before the ceremony, how grandma laughed and danced all night long, and so mouch more. From precious protraits to special in-between moments -I'll save it all for you
